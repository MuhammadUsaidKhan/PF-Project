## Abstract
This project, *Cricket Strike: Test Your Timing & Rule the Stadium*, is an interactive console-based cricket simulation game written in C. The game tests the playerâ€™s reflexes and timing as they attempt to score runs by striking an oncoming ball. Players take control of a batsman, and their goal is to maximize their score while avoiding getting "out" by either missing the ball or letting it hit the stumps.

Key features of the game include:
1. **User Interaction**: The player swings the bat by pressing the 's' key, and their timing determines the runs scored (e.g., six, four, or fewer runs depending on accuracy).
2. **Dynamic Arena**: The cricket field and the ball's movement are rendered dynamically, providing real-time feedback on player actions.
3. **Score Milestones**: Special messages celebrate achievements such as half-centuries (50 runs), centuries (100 runs), and beyond, enhancing player engagement.
4. **Replayability**: Players are offered the option to restart the game upon completion, fostering an engaging and enjoyable experience.
5. **Robust Design**: The game handles user inputs, checks for various scenarios (like hitting stumps or getting caught), and provides clear messages for all possible outcomes.

The implementation uses fundamental programming concepts, including structured programming, dynamic rendering of the game field, and input handling through `_kbhit()` and `_getch()`. It is a beginner-friendly yet engaging project for learning C programming while exploring game design principles.
